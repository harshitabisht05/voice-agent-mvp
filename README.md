## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harshitabisht05/voice-agent-mvp.git
   cd voice-agent-mvp

2. Open in your browser
Just open ```index.html``` in any modern browser that supports the Web Speech API (like Chrome).

## 🧠 How It Works
When you click ```"Start Listening"```, it uses the browser's SpeechRecognition API to listen to your voice.

If you ask something like "Who created you?", the assistant responds with a predefined answer using SpeechSynthesis API.
